# Combobox

A combobox (also known as an autocomplete or autosuggest) component.

A combobox is the combination of an `<input type="text"/>` and a list. The list
is designed to help the user arrive at a value, but the value does not
necessarily have to come from that list. Don't think of it like a `<select/>`,
but more of an input with some suggestions. You can, however, validate that the
value comes from the list, that's up to your app.

<PackageInfo packageData={packageData} componentNames={['Combobox']} />

## Example

```jsx example
<Combobox
    label="Choose a fruit"
    options={[
        { value: 'Apple' },
        { value: 'Banana' },
        { value: 'Orange' },
        { value: 'Pineapple' },
    ]}
/>
```

## Migrating from Troika

-   You should no longer include or import any Troika React's combobox CSS.

### Highlight matched text segments

If you want to highlight the matched text you can set the `matchTextSegments`
prop.

```jsx example
<Combobox
    matchTextSegments
    label="Choose a fruit"
    options={[
        { value: 'Apple' },
        { value: 'Banana' },
        { value: 'Orange' },
        { value: 'Pineapple' },
    ]}
/>
```

Note that this prop only enables the component's default styling for text
matches. You can style text matches however you'd like by overriding styles on
`[data-combobox-text-match]`. For example:

```css example
[data-combobox-text-match] {
    background: yellow;
}
```

## Custom rendering in ComboboxOption

Sometimes you need to render something other than the value as the visible
option, in these cases you can pass a `label`. The label is only for display.
The `value` is what gets sent back when selected.

```jsx example
function Example() {
    return (
        <Combobox
            matchTextSegments
            label="Choose a fruit"
            placeholder="Custom Option Rendering"
            options={[
                { value: 'Apple', label: '🍎 Apple' },
                { value: 'Banana', label: '🍌 Banana' },
                { value: 'Orange', label: '🍊 Orange' },
                { value: 'Pineapple', label: '🍍 Pineapple' },
            ]}
        />
    );
}
```

## Client side search

This example searches an API of Star Wars characters. Combobox does not
implement any matching on your list (aside from highlighting the matched phrases
in an option). Instead, you render an option for each result you want in the
list. So your job is to:

-   Establish the search term state
-   Match the search to your list
-   Render an option for each match

There is nothing special about managing state for a combobox, it's like managing
state for any other list in your app. As the input changes, you figure out what
state you need, then render as many options as you want.

```jsx example
function Example() {
    const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
    const characters = useSWMatch(searchTerm);

    return (
        <Combobox
            matchTextSegments
            label="Star Wars character"
            onChange={(val) => setSearchTerm(val)}
            onSelect={(val) => alert(val)}
            options={characters}
        />
    );
}

// Note that this is a simplified example querying an API on every change to the input field
// Normally you would have some sort of throttling/debouncing and request cancellation
// to reduce the load on both the client and the server.
function useSWMatch(term) {
    const [characters, setCharacters] = React.useState([]);

    React.useEffect(() => {
        if (!term.trim()) return;
        let isFresh = true;

        fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=' + term.trim())
            .then((res) => res.json())
            .then((res) => {
                if (!isFresh) return;
                setCharacters(res.results.map((c) => ({ value: c.name })));
            });

        return () => (isFresh = false);
    }, [term]);

    return characters;
}
```

## Combobox Props

```props packages/combobox/src/component.tsx

```

```ts
export type ComboboxOption = {
    value: string;
    label?: string;
};
```
